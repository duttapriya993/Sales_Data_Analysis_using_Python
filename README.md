## 🔑 Key Insights
- **Laptop, Monitor, and Keyboard** were the **top-selling products**.
- **South & East regions** contributed the highest sales.
- **April, January, and June** showed peak monthly sales.
- **Top-selling products were not always the most profitable** – pricing and discount strategies need optimization.
